# Python-Login-system
This is a basic login system built in python.
Initially, I thought of building a random password generator, and hence the name of the folder is passgen.
I tried changing the project name, but that generated errors. Hence I will update that in the future. Currently, try this version of the project.
In this project, you have all the login/sign-up options and a database that maintains all the credentials in a CSV file. Even when you close and restart the .py file.


Looking forward to making a GUI for this project using Tkinter or kivy.
