# Python-Login-system
THIS IS A BASIC LOGIN SYSTEM BUILT IN PYTHON.
INITIALLY I THOUGHT OF BUILDING A RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR AND HENCE THE NAME OF THE FOLDER IS PASSGEN.
I TRIED CHANGING THE PROJECT NAME, BUT THAT GENRATED ERRORS, HENCE I WILL UPDATE THAT IN FUTURE. CURRENTLY TRY THIS VERSION OF THE PROJECT.
IN THIS PROJECT YOU HAVE ALL THE LOGIN/SIGN UP OPTIONS ALONG WITH A DATABASE THAT MAINTAINS ALL THE CREDENTIALS IN A CSV FILE. EVEN WHEN YOU CLOSE AND RESTART THE .PY FILE


LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING A GUI FOR THIS PROJECT USING TKINTER OR KIVY.
